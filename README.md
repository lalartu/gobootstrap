# gobootstrap
An easy program for my school to create students instances

## Getting started
The easiest way to get started is to use a config file

```toml
[database]
server = "127.0.0.1"
port = 3306
username = "root"
password = ""

[settings]
file = "studenti.txt"
delimiter = "_"
length = 12

[logging]
db = "logs"
table = "gb_logs"

```
